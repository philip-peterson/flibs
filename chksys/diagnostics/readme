diagnostics:
-----------

The program compdiag is intended to check the diagnostic
capabilities of a Fortran compiler. It does so by writing
small programs and passing them to the compiler. The output
is analysed and a report is generated from the findings.

The program is not meant to check whether the compiler
correctly identifies syntactical mistakes (though it does
not really matter, as the generated programs could easily
be adapted for this purpose).

rundiag.sh   -- Linux/UNIX/OSX shell script to run it
compdiag.inp -- file containing the code for the test programs
compile.bat  -- small batch file to run the compiler of choice
compile.sh   -- small shell script to run the compiler of choice
