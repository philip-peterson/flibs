Configuration
-------------
This directory contains include files defining the properties of various
compilers. Via the configure.bat/configure.sh scripts one compiler is
chosen and the corresponding include file is copied to the file
"config.mk".

In a similar way the configuration options are chosen and implemented:
one of normal.mk, debug.mk and optimise.mk is copied to "options.mk"

Note:
This is indeed the nth garden-variety configuration system, but any
general system (autoconf, CMake, Scons to name the best-known) requires
either a Linux/UNIX like OS or at least extra software.

I deemed this project too "small" to warrant such a configuration
system. The method used here is easy to expand and the configuration
options themselves are simple.
