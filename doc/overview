OVERVIEW
--------

src/computing:
--------------
This directory contains:

- automdiff.f90
  Module to use a technique for automatic differentiation: rather than
  just the function, this module allows you to compute the function and
  its first derivative at once.


src/datastructures:
-------------------
The source files together with the corresponding test programs
show how to implement various data structures in a fairly generic way:

- binarytree.f90:
  A first implementation of a binary tree (no attempt to balance the
  structure)

- dictionary.f90:
  Simple dictionary (that is: a mapping from a string to some data)

- linkedlist.f90:
  Classical linked lists

- queues.f90:
  An implementation of a fixed-size queue


src/sqlite:
-----------
Two source files, fsqlite.f90 and csqlite.c define the wrapper routines
to interact with SQLite from a Fortran program.


src/strings:
------------
The source files in this directory manipulate character strings in some
way or another:

- filedir.f90
  Module to manipulate the parts of a file name (directory, name, extension)

- textstr.f90
  Small collection of modules that can help to store strings of arbitrary length.
  It is not meant to implement a general arbitrary-length module: there are only a few
  intrinsic functions emulated.

- csv_file.f90
  Module to help _write_ CSV files
