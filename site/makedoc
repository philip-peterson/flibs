OVERVIEW
--------

src/strings:
------------
The source files in this directory manipulate character strings in some
way or another:

- filedir.f90
  Module to manipulate the parts of a file name (directory, name, extension)

- textstr.f90
  Small collection of modules that can help to store strings of arbitrary length.
  It is not meant to implement a general arbitrary-length module: there are only a few
  intrinsic functions emulated.

- csv_file.f90
  Module to help _write_ CSV files
