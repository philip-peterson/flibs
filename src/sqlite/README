Compiling the Fortran interface to the Sqlite3 library
------------------------------------------------------

The makefile in this directory contains an explanation
of how to build a library from the sources. This 
explanation is geared to:
- UNIX/Linux type platforms (includes Cygwin and MingW
  under Windows and OSX)
- It explains the creation of a static library only

Some of this information is useful for compiling under 
MS Windows as well, but the file names are typical for
the UNIX-type platform.
