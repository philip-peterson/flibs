# Makefile for "fsqlite" library
#
# NOTE:
# You need to adjust the macro DEFINES in this makefile:
# - To select the calling conventions for Fortran and C
# - To set the directory where the Sqlite3 header file can be found
#
# The calling conventions for the Fortran compiler need to
# match those for the C compiler. To this end the following
# macros have been defined in the source code:
#
# - LOWERCASE:
#   Define this macro if the Fortran compiler translates the names to
#   lower case and adds a single underscore
#   E.g.
#   A subroutine SQLITE3_OPEN in the Fortran code becomes sqlite3_open_
#   in the object file.
#
# - DBL_UNDERSCORE:
#   Define this macro if the Fortran compiler translates the names to
#   lower case but adds two underscores if the name itself contains
#   an underscore.
#   E.g.
#   A subroutine SQLITE3_OPEN in the Fortran code becomes sqlite3_open__
#   in the object file.
#
# - WIN32:
#   Under Windows the decoration is often more complicated. Most
#   compilers under Windows define this macro automatically, so it is
#   used to identify this type of decoration, but there can be
#   confusion: under Cygwin and MingW this macro is also defined, but
#   the decorations are not necessarily those of "__stdcall".
#   (Using either of the two others overrides this).
#
# Note:
# Things are further complicated, under Windows at least, if you
# want to create a DLL. The C and Fortran source code as given here
# is not enough then (you need to export routines explicitly from the
# DLL).
