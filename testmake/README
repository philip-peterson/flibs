TestMake: version 1.0, january 2002
-----------------------------------

Notes:
- Directory structure introduced
- Tuned for Java as host language (no "HostLanguage" command yet)
- Code-fragments for Fortran 90 and C as well as support libraries
  available.

The directory examples contains a small example (Java):

- Run the command "tclsh ../bin/testmake.tcl JJ" to create the
  code for the JJ module in that example.

- Copy the two auxiliary JAva source files into the directory and make the
  program.

For more information: see the HTML file in the doc directory and the
article (PostScript and Pdf) in the same directory.
