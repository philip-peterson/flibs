! DEPRECATED - see test_ftnunit.f90 instead
! test_funit.f90 --
!     Program to demonstrate the use of the "funit" framework:
!     It is inspired by the well-known JUnit framework for
!     integrating unit tests in a Java application.
!
!     The program that is being tested is built from three
!     subroutines:
!     - open_files
!     - process_data
!     - report_results
!     The idea is simple:
!     Read a file with data (one number per line) and
!     report some basic statistics.
!
!     While it is a small program, so that it could easily
!     do without separate routines, splitting it into routines
!     makes setting up unit tests much easier.
!
!     The unit tests consist of:
!     1. Try to read a non-existing data file
!     2. Try to read an empty data file
!     3. Try to read a file that does not just contain numbers
!     4. Read a regular file with numbers
!
!     To illustrate the way run-time errors are handled via
!     the framework, some of these tests result in runtime errors
