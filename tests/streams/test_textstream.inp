This file contains a long line to test that the module indeed can handle lines longer than eighty characters, even though it can not handle
individual items longer than eighty characters (more accurately: maxbuf characters)
And of course, we need to be
able to jump to the next line without a problem ...



And empty lines should present no problem
either
(At least one empty line at the end)
